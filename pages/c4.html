We talked about PCBs, their purpose and the way theyâ€™re designed. We went through a brief history of electronics production. We focused mainly on the PCBs which are mainly circuit boards or badges that are soldered/manufactured in a way that reduces possible errors of the circuit functioning.</p><p id="58f31cff-8bab-453b-aa7c-cf2ec091969f" class="">We then went through the different types of PCBs, when theyâ€™re preferred and then talked about the 2 main methods of PCB production which are etching and milling.</p><p id="49c8224b-b8c1-4cbc-833c-6bc4803223bb" class=""><strong>ETCHING:</strong></p><ul id="40af1aec-b59e-4f06-9c09-aa7a307f75f1" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">more accessible/affordable</li></ul><ul id="2ceb4d85-3db8-4584-88d7-be01963d8789" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">difficult to control the procedure</li></ul><p id="f7b025e5-0713-4dd0-ad5e-240e59fd9426" class=""><strong>MILLING:</strong></p><ul id="5f758576-fb51-4e90-a016-fd8109ca5f65" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">more controllable</li></ul><ul id="bf3d9637-be2b-42d0-849e-f4fab240c18e" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">higher quality</li></ul><ul id="d29aa07f-24bc-4e0d-9713-801225377acf" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">less accessible</li></ul><p id="5a65be3d-ca6a-4ce9-bdca-790d9fad4c98" class="">
</p><p id="182f6faf-2e64-4377-ae09-85c760a00a34" class="">There are also other ways of making the PCBs, such as with laser and with vinyl cutters.</p><p id="47120dd8-c1bc-46cd-94cd-d02ef3989123" class="">After talking about the different methods out there, we discussed soldering, and we were given tips on what how to solder efficiently. Then we were split into 2 big groups, where we alternated between soldering and milling digitally PCB badges. We got a quick demonstration in each of the two possible outputs and got to work first-hand in electronics production.</p><p id="06aed222-a415-42c8-a446-655c20669648" class="">
