The project currently focuses on using HDPE plastic, discarded paper and cardboard, food waste and is planned to include other types of waste materials.</p><p id="00f44eb9-7ad4-412b-b15e-f56f0f861fc3" class="">
</p><ol type="1" id="035f9f13-f2c2-4963-8e09-1a9e06817075" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>The project is a place that introduces an access system of repurposing or recycling “trash” in facilities with equipment (i.e. to melt plastic and press paper, hydrate and germinate seeds, etc...) and molds that create modular pieces that the user can build. The explicit moral is pushing the person to create less waste through repurposing. The implicit aspect is that it pushes the user to look at trash with more value.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="14d57140-ce38-415d-8c2d-f77f7a227d2c" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>The main values are sustainability, circularity, and innovation. Though not exclusively targeted at children, this project can help teach them by example, some values of resourcefulness and give them insight on how to counter the hyper consumerist system by changing their views on the materials we use. A downside for this is the risk of defying the purpose of being sustainable by indirectly encouraging the individual to use more plastic or produce more waste to be able to build their artifacts, or to keep purchasing ecologically harmful materials instead of looking for alternatives.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="a3553b17-d516-4d29-8cc6-7fc8811ed831" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>The products of this project will certainly be flawed and imperfect, they do not necessarily have an aesthetic or marketing value, however their real value comes from the mere fact that we have produced them using our own resources and manual skill. This renders the project artifacts as embodiments of the values at hand: lo-fi, slow, rough around the edges but nevertheless functional and  sustainable.
Another value embodied in the design is in the singularity of each piece. In fact, even if two people use the same mold, their results will look different as it will be produced from their own waste, which will not look like a replica of the others. This gives a sense of individuality and intimacy to each of the pieces produced.
And finally, the more material the better, so this project consequently supports the union and the forming of groups and communities, which would make way more with their combined trash than individual users.

While it attempts to counter the common consensus of commodity value, this project might be only accessible to people of higher incomes as they would be more capable of sorting their trash, while the people of lower classes might struggle to get out of their way and pursue such a dynamic.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="0b274989-dc93-4017-abac-40392edeedac" class="numbered-list" start="5"><li>If this project reaches its fruition, it might come in the way of artisans and local shop owners who might be selling the same products.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="3a44339d-7930-46ef-8f8e-af938131f7cb" class="numbered-list" start="6"><li>It can be unevenly beneficial as described in (4). It might be more beneficial to groups than individual, as it might take too long for an individual to produce results from his waste. It can also be environmentally harmful and obsolete if the energy spent to run the equipment is more than the energy spent to purchase a new product. </li></ol><p id="8085441e-1732-4bd8-961c-35653e1ed0a4" class="">
