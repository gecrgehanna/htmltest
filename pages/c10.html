For this reason, I would like to refer back to the 2nd microchallenge, done together with Kai and Ruben. In fact, one of the main important components to make the zoetrope work is the motor. This motor served to turn the disk where the figurines are plugged. </p><p id="5f7713c7-15db-4849-a524-f99220715ef6" class="">In this case, the output, which is the motor, together with the strobe light, both contribute to make the general output of the artifact which is the animation, dependent on both light and speed intervals.</p><figure id="c6382bc7-7ce3-4482-a7fd-b32f271d76e0" class="image"><a href="%E2%9C%85%20c10%20outputs%20c6382bc77ce34482a7fdb32f271d76e0/zoetrope_component-04.png"><img style="width:1124px" src="%E2%9C%85%20c10%20outputs%20c6382bc77ce34482a7fdb32f271d76e0/zoetrope_component-04.png"/></a></figure><p id="87750706-232e-4556-90ce-38784d1a00d3" class="">During this microchallenge, the electronics design of the piece was one of the more prominent and important. The motor speed was controlled by a potentiometer, which was in this case the input source. More about this in the inputs task documentation.</p><p id="6f55ccfb-b8d9-4ef1-ae48-e5d2cfec2f31" class="">
