While as a team, we had more of a unanimous interest on building a zoetrope, it was more or less difficult to make it functional by the end of the challenge, mainly due to the technical adequacy that zoetropes require. The strobe light and the speed of the disk, the placement and the angle of the figurines all need to be synchronized in a way in order to create the magic of the animation.</p><p id="865f609b-2bf3-4ff3-99b0-f3fcf2807dc2" class="">If any of these factors mentioned above is slightly off, the whole thing comes out clunky and disjointed. Such artifacts are surely more difficult to make functional at a prototype stage, but the concept and idea were there and we were able to translate it very well. Personally, I felt a bit separated from the electronics part and more focused on the design aspect of the animation and the flow of it.</p><p id="1514ce75-b32a-478b-b6fb-a8ef33acb7c5" class="">For the next challenge, I would definitely like to be more involved in the electronics part and get more acquainted with making these things <work class="br"><br><br><a href="https://github.com/gecrgehanna/fabchallenge02/blob/main/README.md">repo link here</a></work></p></div></article></body></html>
