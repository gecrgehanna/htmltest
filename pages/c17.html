The project currently focuses on using HDPE plastic, discarded paper and cardboard, food waste and is planned to include other types of waste materials.

</strong></span>Help people find different uses for their domestic waste by repurposing it into other functional objects.

</strong></span>- Precious Plastics have been experimenting with such concepts, specifically related to plastic for a while.
- Also Brothers Make have been focusing on HDPE plastics by using advanced workshop machinery.
- Remix El Barrio, Lara Campos, and the biomaterials people who have been restlessly experimenting and working on new exciting recipes from food waste to other types of objects (textile, paper, containers, etcâ€¦)

</strong></span>Most importantly, a structured system under which this whole project can work and expand on. The design process will also include:
- designing the molds which could include some modular designs that would help each person expand and build in their own way
- designing manuals to help assemble and fabricate the molds in an open-source context
- designing alternatives for molds using domestic appliances
- designing a website where all these recipes and open files would exist and where the community can add to the database.<span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid"><strong>

</strong></span>Mostly melted aluminum foil, wood as well as some soft molds that can include silicone or gel-based molds.

</strong></span>It will be fabricated either using digital fabrication facilities and workshops or with some more conventional and accessible tools at home, depending on the complexity of the mold and the design.

</strong></span>As this project opens up a lot of possibilities, there is no fixed price on the cost of these as they can vary. But the purpose is to keep it as accessible and affordable as possible.

</strong></span>This project incorporates a multi-disciplinary, multi-method approach. The main processes are digital fabrication (mainly including laser cutters, 3d printers, CNC), but it can include a more crafty DIY approach, using basic kitchenware such as bowls, trays, spoons, etcâ€¦<span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid"><strong>

</strong></span>- How affordable and accessible will the fabrication of these molds be?
- Should they be fabricated and distributed before hand or can we find a way to make the user fabricate the mold themselves?
- How much would people be able to follow through with the recipes and directions on the website?<span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid"><strong>
