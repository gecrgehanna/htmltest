Where we go through unconventional fabrication techniques and methods that we didn‚Äôt go through previously. </p><p id="2ce23843-6b00-4cb9-ba90-d02f002e38e0" class="">These include, soft robotics, inflatables, wearables, composites, paste printing and the robotic arm. We were able to interact with the kuka robotic arm for the first time during this week, which was very interesting and opened a world of possibilities in my head. This was our last fabacademy class, however, they scheduled a soft robotics class the week after where people would show up if they‚Äôre interested. I was in Lebanon at that time, so I couldn‚Äôt attend.</p><p id="157c2cc0-f03c-4521-b313-0de4c66aec3f" class="">Due to the quick pacing and the overwhelming dues, Kai and I opted for something simple where we asked the assistance of Aparna and Didac and replicated the process they did for their 3rd microchallenge. We used a plastic bag and used the laser cutter in order to fuse the edges together.</p><figure id="26b4b926-4c3e-442c-b162-0d559b270baf" class="image"><a href="%E2%9C%85%20c16%20wildcard%2026b4b9264c3e442cb1620d559b270baf/6298ae9ad79f96a968675596_Globo3-p-2000.jpg"><img style="width:2000px" src="%E2%9C%85%20c16%20wildcard%2026b4b9264c3e442cb1620d559b270baf/6298ae9ad79f96a968675596_Globo3-p-2000.jpg"/></a></figure><p id="1edd03a8-7039-4855-ab88-52d5fb7500dc" class="">It was unfortunate to not be able with some other exciting things like the paste printer or the robotic arm, but this week opened many horizons and curiosities in my head.</p><p id="9369b1ae-2002-4459-b18a-c46b3797355d" class="">
