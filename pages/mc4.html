We had the interest in tackling themes of parasites and seeing different ways of representing them, and what better way than p5.js. </p><p id="e6175b43-0477-42ab-bad1-0aeea508e702" class="">We have both dabbled in p5.js before and we have tried to create an interesting approach to showcasing different thoughts that we had on screen referring to Alien Melonâ€™s work, as we had limited time. Using p5.js is such an interesting and open world of its own, I was overwhelmed from the possibilities of this tool and I am looking forward to take my time after MDEF and learn some p5.js courses.</p><p id="fbb5e5b9-1973-4540-a7ab-d0174d5e2079" class="">
