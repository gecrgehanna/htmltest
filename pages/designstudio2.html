I had thought about going for something less theoretical and be more straight-forward with my approach. </p><h2 id="4cbbbb23-7624-461e-a81d-7789a5d2ddd6" class=""><mark class="highlight-teal"><span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid">a. toys with past lives </span></mark></h2><h3 id="ad6e7a48-4cf7-4f18-9ef2-2d147681d5b7" class="">PART 1 - litter to glitter</h3><p id="0b8a83c1-a60d-4842-9b9e-f240780f8e14" class="">So I thought to myself ‚ÄúWhat do I enjoy doing?‚Äù And suddenly, I had many answers. In fact, during the first term, Kai and Anna had been working on children‚Äôs toys with biomaterials and electronics. And having sculpted puppets<em> (fig. 1) </em>before, I decided to approach them. The purpose was to find an intervention in which I would be using my hands rather than spend hours in front of the screen. Manual work for me is where I fully get lost in the flow. </p><figure id="c8922b1d-68de-41a2-8e7e-8fa8c47f6f3b" class="image"><a href="design%20stu%20c8922/friends.png"><img style="width:480px" src="design%20stu%20c8922/friends.png"/></a></figure><p id="b81e4fea-de10-42d5-9c1f-6dce645ba979" class="">fig. 1 <mark class="highlight-orange"><em>previous personal work: magnetic puppets for my niece</em></mark></p><p id="b5086c9b-2066-4747-b2ac-0f91b73a9ed0" class="">Conveniently, in our first Design Studio class after the break, we were supposed to present a 3-min pitch, going over what we had done in the first term, and where we would like to direct our work in this coming term. So I presented my areas of interest and where I would like to execute my new design intervention. Directly after, I joined Kai and Anna‚Äôs group and we started a Whatsapp group together where we would discuss some possible ideas.</p><p id="8355f265-4988-43be-9afc-d3cc687fa355" class="">Interestingly enough, we had developed an initiative together with D√≠dac, Audrey, Paula Bustos, Andrea, and others... which had a common interest of collecting discarded objects and garbage from the neighborhood. However, each of us had their own purpose. I proposed to the toys group that we try to create toys from waste material. And together with recently included, Borka, we set out to repurpose some random objects into possible toys <em>(fig. 2)</em>. </p><figure id="6948e3a8-6ff4-4670-8821-ccc021a32d84" class="image"><a href="design%20stu%20c8922/Screen_Shot_2022-03-07_at_8.48.18_PM.png"><img style="width:1140px" src="design%20stu%20c8922/Screen_Shot_2022-03-07_at_8.48.18_PM.png"/></a></figure><p id="2519e635-dede-4ffa-b08e-b7e6660c2115" class="">fig. 2 <mark class="highlight-orange"><em>A repurposed chair and shower curtain rings</em></mark></p><p id="88fede3c-ab1e-4c4b-817d-62671fc7ae5f" class="">We had prepared some interesting toys and thought about what other things to make.
