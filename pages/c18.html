How we manage our project and how do we avoid issues such as law infringement, copyright issues, intellectual property, and some other ethical questions like data management, and finally, how to make a profit from a project.</p><p id="76188da7-3be5-4f5c-b911-1e45574c981c" class="">For this specific session I was absent, but my teammates had prepared a dissemination plan for their projects and chose a type of licensing for the project.</p><p id="aa306aaf-588d-4a47-8abe-9598bc4b7565" class="">Transmolds offers a system of fabricated lo-fi, open source, molds that can be used in a domestic space with the typical domestic appliances to repurpose waste into modular functional objects for a wide array of purposes. The project currently focuses on using HDPE plastic, discarded paper and cardboard, food waste and is planned to include other types of waste materials.</p><p id="e588fd5e-39db-4d40-9013-1e8d10b2dacf" class="">Such an open-source project can be difficult to contain or specify, especially at such an early experimental stage where things aren‚Äôt clearly defined yet and the project could take an unexpected direction based on community engagement or resource accessibility or lack thereof. Despite these things, the main values of the projects is to stay as open and shareable and replicable as possible and to keep it as accessible and affordable as possible as well.</p><p id="f2f8d475-4016-4c29-ba91-059e6840bcb6" class="">For this purpose, I would choose a creative commons license, where the mold designers, which would be transmolds team could profit and maintain credit for the intellectual and design work they have put. </p></div></article></body></html>
