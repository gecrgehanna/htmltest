Kai and I get along pretty well and we both prioritized the experimentation process. We were not very concerned about having a final output as much as we wanted to try different ways of reaching our solution. </p><p id="7c26a387-5a03-499d-a356-38a5a33f4d28" class="">Doing this allowed me to realize the importance of the medium used and how much it responds to factors such as efficiency, sustainability and resources availability. All the molds wouldâ€™ve been impossible to make without a laser cutting machine, for example. Some of the molds we tried to use clay for a more sustainable process, however this was impossible due to the porous properties of the clay which sucked the water from the biomaterials and made the process of separating the molds much more difficult.</p><p id="07dc5eef-8dee-4e2c-bceb-2ae3cb8e5234" class="">All in all, it was a very fun process for our first challenge, things were very coordinated and smooth, the final result definitely needs more refinement, however, the effort we put definitely opened new <doors class="br"><br><br><a href="https://github.com/gecrgehanna/fabchallenge01/blob/main/README.md">repo link here</a></doors></p></div></article></body></html>
