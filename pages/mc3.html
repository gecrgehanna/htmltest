As per my last decision to be more involved in the electronics part, I went head first into the inner workings of the microcontroller, how to pair it with Arduino as well as other complementary softwares/tools needed in order to make our artifact functional.</p><p id="989867ba-34f1-4dd2-bea6-167b2aec12bd" class="">The light measurer was a success, however we did not have the time to fully make it reach its full potential as it is very dependent on the presence of a database, which we were not able to fully achieve as it requires a lot of time. Another thing that is missing is the calibration of conversion between the photoresistorâ€™s unit system and the lux measuring system. </p><p id="6479ed83-7cc4-4b70-b63e-b4845b2e97be" class="">In my opinion, the photoresistor would be better replaced with a more efficient light sensor, something that auto-calibrates the amount of light that is measured. However, I understand that during to the limitations of our resources, we did not have time/the options to try different and more advanced tool. Having said that, I enjoyed working with the rawest tools out there, as I believe this is the most difficult thing to do, adding pre-calibrated components provides shortcuts in the whole process.</p></div></article><br><br><a href="https://github.com/julia-steketee/Fab-Academy-Challenge-3">repo link here</a></body></html>
