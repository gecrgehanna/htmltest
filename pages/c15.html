We also went briefly over p5.js and learned how to pair that with arduino through p5 serial monitor to create a network between the two, using either USB, Bluetooth or Wifi, depending on the capabilities of electronic board we are using. </p><p id="6387d8b1-96a5-4c6c-9a6e-b4f590bcdeaa" class="">For this week’s assignment, together with Julia, we worked on creating the light measurer, a gardening companion that is connected to a database where we’d have different amounts of light values in Lux for different gardening projects. The light measurer would serve as an index to identify and compare optimal places to put plants, dehydrators, seeds, compost, etc…</p><p id="9842a853-6aa9-45a6-9033-9a9bfbdf7ff4" class="">For this specific task, we had already set an Arduino board with a bluetooth module (HC-06) and a photo-resistor to capture the light data and send it to the PC. </p><p id="71df0f7b-ed7e-4792-8671-2b3b2bd9a00d" class="">To fulfill the assignment task, we had to use an interface to visualize the data, which is why we resorted to p5.js. Below is the code.</p><figure id="889fa41a-a714-4905-ae9b-1378c954e43e" class="image"><a href="%E2%9C%85%20c15%20interface%20&amp;%20application%20programming%20889fa41aa7144905ae9b1378c954e43e/p5js.png"><img style="width:2280px" src="%E2%9C%85%20c15%20interface%20&amp;%20application%20programming%20889fa41aa7144905ae9b1378c954e43e/p5js.png"/></a></figure><p id="a5677ed3-011b-4e30-9f54-dd3bb880492c" class="">You can find more of this completed project in the 3rd fabacademy microchallenge. </p></div></article></body></html>
