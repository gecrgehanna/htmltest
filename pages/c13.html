For this reason, I would like to refer back to the 2nd microchallenge, done together with Kai and Ruben. In this case, the zoetrope, consisting of a turning disk animatied by a motor), a strobe light and the figurines create the whole component.</p><figure id="c3381e87-efbf-4ae8-be1c-05f4a275b4b4" class="image"><a href="%E2%9C%85%20c13%20inputs%20c3381e87efbf4ae8be1c05f4a275b4b4/cuteled.gif"><img style="width:691px" src="%E2%9C%85%20c13%20inputs%20c3381e87efbf4ae8be1c05f4a275b4b4/cuteled.gif"/></a></figure><p id="53f3b3d3-0198-4917-88b5-219cbdf849b5" class="">But since the synchronization of the strobe speed and spinning speed is a very meticulous process, we decided to make the light strobe a constant, and the motor speed to be controlled. Which is why we have added a potentiometer to the whole circuit, which helped us increase and decrease the spinning speed.</p><p id="19eef366-1ae7-4419-8ac0-00bf77694fc9" class="">In this case, the potentiometer was the input which would translate the turning of the knob to the speed of the motor, one of the outputs in this case. The presence of this input-output system in this case helped us synchronize the speeds together and achieve the flow of the animation.</p><p id="917fc97a-cb2c-41e0-9552-669cfa9f63d8" class="">
